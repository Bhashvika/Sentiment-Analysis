Develop a sentiment analysis model to classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative

The proposed system aims to classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative to help restaurants improve their services and attract new customers. This involves leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques to analyze sentiment accurately. The solution will consist of the following components:
Data Collection:
Gather historical data on restaurant reviews, including text reviews and corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative).
 Utilize additional data sources, such as review timestamps and user information, to enhance the context of sentiment analysis.
Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Feature engineering to extract relevant features from the text data that might impact sentiment classification. This includes tokenization, removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatization.
Machine Learning Algorithm:
Implement a machine learning algorithm to classify the sentiment of reviews.
Explore algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or neural networks for classification.
The model is optimized through hyperparameter tuning and by incorporating additional contextual factors that could influence the sentiment, such as the specific words used in the reviews or the overall length of the review.
Deployment:
A user-friendly interface is developed, which allows users to input new reviews and receive instant sentiment classification results.
The model is deployed on a robust and scalable platform, ensuring that it can handle a high volume of requests with minimal latency.

Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure that it can classify sentiments with a high degree of reliability.
A system is put in place to collect feedback on the model's predictions, which is used to make continuous improvements to the model.
Result:
The end result is a sophisticated sentiment analysis system that can accurately classify restaurant reviews. This system serves as a valuable tool for restaurant owners to understand customer sentiment and make informed decisions to improve their services and attract new customers![image](https://github.com/Bhashvika/Sentiment-Analysis/assets/108601714/fdaa55fe-4b32-4543-bfa8-22d03cfc2511)
